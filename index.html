        <h1> The four components of the Emblem</h1>
        The four components of the emblem are a crescent and star crest above a shield, which is surrounded by a wreath, below which is a scroll.[2] The crest and the green colour of the emblem are traditional symbols of Islam. The quartered shield in the centre shows cotton, wheat, tea and jute, which were the major crops of Pakistan at independence and are shown in a form of shield and signify as the main agricultural base for the importance of the Nation's economy.[2] The floral wreath, surrounding the shield, is Jasminum officinale (the national flower) and represents the floral designs used in traditional Mughal art and emphasizes the cultural heritage of Pakistan.[2] The scroll supporting the shield contains the national motto in Urdu, "Īmān, Ittiḥād, Naẓm", which reads from right to left: (ایمان، اتحاد، نظم), translated as "Faith, Unity, Discipline" which are intended as the guiding principles for Pakistan. This logo was designed by Maraj Muhammad student of National College of Arts
